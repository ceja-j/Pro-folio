#  ART Notes

## Art is as old as humans have existed on planet earth

![Old Human Art](images/download.jpeg "Mention prehistoric art, and most people think of cave paintings like those in Chauvet Cave near Avignon, France, or the Lascaux Caves near Bordeaux. But these are relatively recent and sophisticated examples of prehistoric art; most of the paintings in Chauvet Cave, for example, were made by early modern humans between 28,000 and 37,000 years ago, while those in the Lascaux Caves are thought to have been created even more recently, around 17,000 years ago.")

## Drawings and paintings are NOT the same although Drawing skecthes can help painters know were to paint

| Features | Drawing | Painting |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Primary Medium | Dry media (pencil, charcoal, chalk, ink pens, pastel) | Wet media (oil paint, acrylic paint, watercolor, gouache, tempera) | 
Surface | Most often paper, but also canvas or wood | Most often canvas, wood panels, or specially prepared paper | 
Focus | Emphasizes line, form, tone/shading, and texture | Emphasizes color, texture, and complex composition | 
Process | Generally more immediate and spontaneous | Often more time-consuming, involving layering and blending |

## The lines between drawing and painting often blur BTW.

## Many artists use a sketch as the foundation for a painting, and some drawings, like those made with colored pencils or soft pastels, are so rich with color they feel like paintings.



# The Building Blocks: Essential Drawing Techniques
## Think of these techniques as the foundational skills for creating the illusion of form, shadow, and depth on a flat surface.

# Hatching & Cross-Hatching: Drawing with Lines

![Example of Hatching and Cross-Hatching](images/hatching.jpg "Cross Hatch Practice")

## Hatching is the use of fine, parallel lines to create shading. Cross-hatching layers another set of lines in a different direction (often perpendicular) over the first to build up darker tones. 

## The primary goal of both techniques is to create tonal values and shadow. The closer the lines are to each other, the darker the shadow appears, giving a drawing a powerful sense of three-dimensional form.

### See example below

# Stippling: Building Tone with Dots
## Stippling is a method of creating tone and texture using patterns of dots.

## Similar to hatching, stippling is used to build up tone and create unique textures. Areas with a higher concentration of dots appear darker, while sparser dots create lighter tones, allowing for soft, subtle gradients. It's a patient process, but the results can be stunningly soft and realistic.

# The World of Color & Texture: Expressive Painting Techniques
## These techniques focus on the physical qualities of the paint itself to create drama, convey emotion, and add a tangible sense of energy to the artwork.
# Chiaroscuro: The Drama of Light and Dark
## Chiaroscuro is an Italian term for the dramatic use of strong contrasts between light and dark. Its primary effect is to create a powerful sense of volume and depth in a painting, making figures seem to emerge from a dark background. This technique was famously mastered by artists like Caravaggio and Rembrandt to give their figures incredible weight and presence.
### See example below
![Example of Chiaroscure drawing](images/1753437747.jpg "Renaissance religious art frequently employed chiaroscuro to evoke divine mystery and transcendence. Figures such as the Virgin Mary or Christ were often bathed in soft, radiant light against darker surroundings, symbolizing their holiness. Caravaggio’s The Entombment of Christ, for instance, uses such contrasts to place emotional and spiritual emphasis on its central figures.  ")
# Impasto: Painting with Texture You Can Feel
## Impasto is the technique of applying paint so thickly that it physically stands out from the surface. The individual brush strokes or even marks from a palette knife are clearly visible, making the brushwork a key part of the artwork itself. Its primary effect is to create visible texture and dimension, adding an expressive energy to the painting.
## Artists like Van Gogh favored the Impasto technique to convey intense emotion and energy in his work. These are just a few of the many powerful tools an artist can use to bring their vision to life.
