## Note: There are three main colors they are: RED, YELLOW, and BLUE. THey are known as the primary (Main) colors

## Step 1: The Divine Presence & Path (Lightest/Warmest)

### Start with your brightest, lightest color: the Yellow.

### Use your clean, damp brush to "paint" the water onto the exact shape and size of the central Radiant Blob/Eye and the entire Golden Path. Do not add any color yet—just water.

## First Yellow Wash:

### Mix your most diluted yellow and drop it into the wet areas you just mapped. The yellow will softly bloom within those shapes. Let this dry completely.

## Define the Eye:

### Use your brush tip and your most concentrated yellow (or darkest color if available) to quickly paint the small detail of the Eye.

Note: Watercolor must be built from light to dark. If you paint the dark clouds first, you will never be able to achieve a truly pure, luminous yellow light over them. You must lay down the light first.

## Step 2: The Clouds (Cooler/Deeper)

Note: Move to your darkest color: the Blue.

## Wet the Cloud Area

### Wet the areas around the dry yellow path and figure. Be careful not to let the water touch the yellow if you can help it (if it's dry, it won't run, but it's best practice to avoid disturbing it).

## First Blue Wash 

### Apply your lightest blue wash (mostly water) to establish the initial tone and swirl of the clouds.

## Build Depth

### As the paper starts to dry, introduce your darker, more concentrated blue into the areas you want to recede into shadow, following the funnel shape of your reference photo. Crucially, stop painting the blue right next to the path and figure to create that strong contrast.

## Step 3: Final Details & Contrast

## Halo

### If you want a hard-edged halo, use a very small amount of pale yellow to define the Triangle Halo, ensuring your clouds are fully dry before you do this.

## Path Refinement

### If the path needs to look sharper or more vibrant, apply a second, slightly stronger wash of yellow to the path, being careful to stay within the lines you established.

# Final Order: Yellow Light → Blue Clouds → Final Yellow Details.
