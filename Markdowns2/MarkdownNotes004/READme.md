### I usually go to sleep around 8,9 or 10 or 11 and sometimes 12. Going to bed is just resting and watching TV or my phone until I actualy start feeling sleepy. I usally wake up at 7,8, or 9 on a non - school day. I usually rarely take naps at all. I have found myself feeling tired or almost falling asleep during class a few times.
